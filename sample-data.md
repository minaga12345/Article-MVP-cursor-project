**Sarah Chen**: Yes, we founded AIFlow in 2020 with a vision to democratize AI development.

**Sarah Chen**: The key challenges include scaling infrastructure and maintaining model quality while keeping the platform accessible to developers of all skill levels. We had to build systems that could handle massive workloads while ensuring that every developer gets the same high-quality experience, regardless of when they're using the platform.

**Interviewer**: How has the platform grown since then?

**Sarah Chen**: The platform has grown to serve over 10,000 developers worldwide. We've seen incredible adoption across different industries, from individual hobbyists building personal projects to enterprise teams creating production-ready AI applications.

**Interviewer**: That's impressive growth. What do you attribute this success to?

**Sarah Chen**: We believe in open-source principles and community-driven development. Our success isn't just measured by our metrics, but by the success of our community and the innovative solutions they're building on our platform. We've created a vibrant ecosystem where developers share knowledge, collaborate on projects, and push the boundaries of what's possible with AI.

**Interviewer**: What's next for AIFlow? What are your future plans?

**Sarah Chen**: Our future plans include expanding to enterprise markets and new AI capabilities. We're exploring new frontiers in AI development, including more specialized tools for different industries and use cases. We're not just building for today's needs - we're thinking about what developers will need in five years, and we're building the foundation for that future now.

**Interviewer**: Any final thoughts for our audience?

**Sarah Chen**: The future of AI development is in the hands of the community. By combining technical excellence with community-driven principles, we can ensure that innovation remains accessible to everyone. We're excited to be part of this journey.
